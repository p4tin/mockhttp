# mockhttp -- Go package for unit testing HTTP serving

Unit testing HTTP services written in Go means you need to call their
`ServeHTTP` receiver. For this, you need something that fulfills the
`http.ResponseWriter` interface, and you need to populate a
`http.Request` struct with suitable-looking data. `mockhttp.go`
helps you do these tasks, without excessive copy-pasting.

See `mockhttp_test.go` for an example of usage.
